# Projects:
This is a short list of projects I have been involved in that can be somewhat interesting to the readers:

## [Atomphys](https://github.com/tiqi-group/atomphys/tree/tiqi-main)

Co-authors: Carmelo Mordini, Matt Grau

Atomphys is a library to interface with the various databases of atomic data. It can be used to calculate properties of the atoms interacting with light, and construct all required elements for simulating the quantum dynamics of the electron in an atom through Master Equation.

## [MUD - Moisture Under Detection](https://itsmud.com)

Co-authors: Peter Phillman Pedersen, CÃ©line Portenier

As part of the HackEO Zurich 2024 "Pixels for the planet" we (Peter, Celine, and I) have build a mock-up of a product and designed a technology that explains the need for more accurate moisture detection in the soil. We believe that by constructing a synthetic dataset of the soil moisture we can train a machine learning model to predict the moisture content changes of the soil with accuracy better than 0.05 $\frac{\text{m}^3}{\text{m}^3}$ using publically available satellite data. This would allow to see the rainfall, and derive yield index for backcasting the yield of the crops.

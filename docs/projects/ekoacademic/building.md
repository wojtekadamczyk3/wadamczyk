# Building ekoAcademic

Co-authors: Aidan McConnel, Shaan Amin

It was a fun project to build, We used this project as an excuse to play around with vibe-coding, and managed to build a very useful draft quite quickly.

## Principles we followed

- Build for ourselves first: solve our own commute-use case end to end.
- Ship fast, iterate faster: vibe-coding sessions, thin slices, frequent testing.
- Audio-first UX: frictionless playback, hands-free control, short-form by default.
- Conversation at the core: realtime Q&A to go beyond passive listening.
- Multilingual by default: speech and text in many languages.
- Cache and reuse: store generated podcasts to avoid recomputation.
- Mirror the literature: track new arXiv releases and sensible categories.
- Keep it simple: minimal clicks, clear flows, and low cognitive load.

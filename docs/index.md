# Abstract

Thoughts are transient, and to make them stay in place the author tried to capture them in the form of text. Both silly and less-silly thoughts were written. It was observed that whilst writing the author was achieving slightly better understanding of the topics he was writing about. The enjoyment of the readers is still to be investigated.

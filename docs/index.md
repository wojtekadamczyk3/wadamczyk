# About me:
I am Wojciech Adamczyk.
I am a PhD student in [Jonathan Home's](https://tiqi.ethz.ch) group at ETH Zurich, working on **Calcium Rydberg Atoms in Tweezer Arrays**. I have previously worked 
with [Didier Queloz](https://www.lclu.cam.ac.uk) @ Cambridge University on measuring 
**Precipitable Water Vapor using Remote Sensing** and with Hartmut Schlums @ Rolls 
Royce Deutschland on **Multiaxial Fatigue of Allvac718Plus**. Currently, I'm fascinated by the intricacies of atomic physics, non-diagonal Hamiltonian elements, motional states, optical aberrations, maximum likelihood estimation methods, and AI safety research. I like hacking, writing and playing violin.

I deeply enjoy supervising master and semester and random project students. If you would like to work with me as a master student apply [here](tiqi-application@lists.phys.ethz.ch), otherwise send me a direct message [here](wadamczyk@phys.ethz.ch). Please in the application mention my name.
